# Nstring - Custom String Class in C#

This project implements a custom string class `Nstring` in C# with operator overloading to extend string manipulation functionality.

## Features

- Concatenation (`+`) of `Nstring` objects
- Repetition (`*`) of strings with newline separators
- Substring removal (`-`)
- Counting occurrences (`/`)
- Adding a random character (`++`)
- Removing last character (`--`)
- Extracting substring using modulo operator (`%`)
- Equality checks (`==`, `!=`, `Equals` override)

## Usage

Example usage in `Program.cs` shows how to test all implemented operators and methods.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio Community
3. Build and run the `Program.cs` to see `Nstring` functionality in action
